Umm... It's been an eventful couple of months. I broke up with my girlfriend of 5+ years, I went from being a designer to a developer, and I learned how to be a slightly better human in the process.

I just wanted to make something truly great, damn the consequences. But living, and being haunted by, that kind of singular determination makes one harsh. Defining your personal worth solely by the quality of your work means that you'll never be good enough.

A funny thing happens when you come up for air â€“ looking back, the failures don't actually matter. Maybe, I'm also hoping the same applies to relationships.
