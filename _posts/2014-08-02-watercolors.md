title:  "Some Watercolors"

I took a break from coding [Tello][tello] last week to noodle around with watercolors. Here's one of the things I did. It's far from good, or finished, but that's okay.

Despite the amateur results, dipping my toes in the world of real paints and brushes is always totally worth it.
