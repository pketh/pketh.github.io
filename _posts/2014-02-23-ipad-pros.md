title:  "iPad Pro(s)"
---

Much has been speculated on the future of ipads and mainstream computing. Most recently, that there needs to be a iPad Pro for real serious people that's as large as a laptop, allows multiple windows - but also isn't less ergonomic, more complicated to use, or less capable than OSX. So magic then.

Thing is, I think we may pretty much already have the iPad Pro - just buy another iPad and use them both together.

Imagine you have 5 sheets of paper stacked on top of each other, this is the ipad right now:

Even if you can quickly switch between pages, you can only view one thing at a time. This one screen, one app model is really easy to understand but doesn't scale to complex workflows so well.

If you wanted to view two of those paper sheets side-by-side what would you do? You'd likely just put the pages next to each other.

In the same vein, if you wanted to view a news story, while editing a photo to put into a blogpost why wouldn't you use a device for each task/app?

The reason you probably wouldn't do that right now, is because iCloud isn't sophisticated enough for this yet. But if it was?

* A designer working on a website with a stylus could have an image editor in one iPad, a copy of [diet Coda][dietcoda] in another and a site preview in another. iCloud would let you reference the image in your site's code and the web preview would instantly update.
* Or, a programmer using a physical keyboard could grab an additional ipad to become a second (or third) [text editing][texttastic] window. iCloud would detect the nearby device and enable a shared clipboard and a single active cursor between the devices.

You could probably come up with others, from everyday useful to full on [apple ad][ad].

Revolutionary products tend to look obvious in retrospect. Sometimes they're obvious even earlier.
