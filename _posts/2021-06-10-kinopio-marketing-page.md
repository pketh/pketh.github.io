In theory, every marketing website has the same basic job “Here’s _what_ this thing is, here’s _how_ you can use it, and _why_ it can help you.”

Beyond that, special products vibe with you and your aspirations. They wink “This will help you live the stress-free, creative life that you yearn for.”

To do this, the three weeks I spent writing, designing, and building the new [About Kinopio page](https://help.kinopio.club/about) almost broke me.

I started with words. If I can make something compelling in a .txt file, that's a good place to build from. Strangely, I think clearly describing what a product does is probably hardest for the person who made it. But all the [feedback](https://kinopio.club/ideas-for-growing-kinopio-WjASP_gR0dWatK1Avy_rJ) I've gotten from readers of the Kinopio email bulletin was super helpful in figuring out what themes and use-cases to focus on.


## How it Looks, How it Works

Aesthetically, I wanted the page to feel approachable, but also memorable and characterful. I’m trying to sell the idea of Kinopio to you – not some amo

I started the design process by collecting my goals and [inspiration](/decade-of-inspiration.html) in a [mood-board space](https://kinopio.club/about-site-redesign-w-fonts-La3P2hMCw_4s6PGvuv-R_).

Just like with Kinopio itself, I wanted the way you interact with this page to have a little extra somethin' somethin'.

So, the page paints itself. Kind of like I'm sitting on your shoulder and I'm saying "hey check this out, and also this part is really cool".

## Building Auto-Paint

?twizzler reference

To build auto-painting, I wrote some code that [recorded](https://github.com/kinopio-club/kinopio-help/blob/master/assets/js/magic-paint.js) my paint strokes, and then transforms the position and timing of those [recorded strokes](https://github.com/kinopio-club/kinopio-help/blob/master/assets/js/recorded-strokes.js) to [auto-paint](https://github.com/kinopio-club/kinopio-help/blob/master/assets/js/auto-paint.js) them next to specific elements on the page.

Honestly, this was kind of a nightmare. I should've chosen an easier profession, like navy seal.
