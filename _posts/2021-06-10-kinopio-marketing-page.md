In theory, every marketing website has the same basic job “Here’s _what_ this thing is, here’s _how_ you can use it, and _why_ it can help you.”

Beyond that, special products hope to vibe with your higher aspirations. “This will help you live the calm, creative life that you yearn for.”

To this end, the three weeks I spent writing, designing, and building the new [About Kinopio page](https://help.kinopio.club/about) almost broke me.

I started with words. If I can make something compelling in a .txt file, that's a good place to build from. Strangely, I think clearly describing what a product does is probably hardest for the person who made it. But all the [feedback](https://kinopio.club/ideas-for-growing-kinopio-WjASP_gR0dWatK1Avy_rJ) I've gotten from readers of the Kinopio email bulletin was super helpful in figuring out what themes and use-cases to focus on.


## How it Looks, How it Works

My design process began by writing out my goals and [collecting inspiration](/decade-of-inspiration.html) in a [mood-board space](https://kinopio.club/about-site-redesign-w-fonts-La3P2hMCw_4s6PGvuv-R_).

Much of the initial inspiration came from going down the rabbit holes of [Fonts in Use](https://fontsinuse.com). Besides finding typefaces, there's a lot of compelling layouts and art direction to be found in the books and posters on the site that we rarely see on the web.

### font process

downloaded font trials,
going through all the fonts
- I didn’t end up that close to the stuff in my inspiration space, a starting point, inpsiration is not a destination.

page headers set in Jean Luc typeface (http://carvalho-bernau.com/jlg/), had for 10years, liked the 60s cigarette-y frenchness of it, inspired by movie titles.

I've had teh font on my harddrive for 10? years, survived teh migration across various computers, never used

through out most of the copy and pulled and poked at the rest of the copy inline with the design, new templates. (after/past a point,) `html` and `css` are the only design tools that matter.



Just like with Kinopio itself, I wanted the way you interact with this page to have a little extra somethin' somethin'.

So, the page paints itself. Kind of like I'm sitting on your shoulder and I'm saying "hey check this out, and also this part is really cool".

## Building Auto-Paint

?twizzler reference

To build auto-painting, I wrote some code that [recorded](https://github.com/kinopio-club/kinopio-help/blob/master/assets/js/magic-paint.js) my paint strokes, and then transforms the position and timing of those [recorded strokes](https://github.com/kinopio-club/kinopio-help/blob/master/assets/js/recorded-strokes.js) to [auto-paint](https://github.com/kinopio-club/kinopio-help/blob/master/assets/js/auto-paint.js) them next to specific elements on the page.

Honestly, this was kind of a nightmare. I should've chosen an easier profession, like navy seal.
