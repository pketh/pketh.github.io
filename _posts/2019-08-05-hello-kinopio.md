title:  "Hello Kinopio"

It's been ~3 months since I quit Glitch. From outside the city, amidst community gardens, fireflies, and lazing cats, I want to tell you what I've been working on.

[Kinopio](https://kinopio.club) is designed to:
1. Get the chaotic messy thoughts and ideas out of your head
2. Show you how they’re connected
3. Help you figure out what they mean, and how to start working on them

Instead of neatly structured forms and lists like a traditional planning tool, Kinopio works like your brain does. The best way to explain that is with a little tour of [kinopio.club](https://kinopio.club):

Tap anywhere to make a new card. Put an idea, thought, or feeling in it. It doesn't need to make sense right now. Make some more, wherever you want. Drag cards to move them with a jolly wiggle.

By now some of these ideas might be connected – so let's connect them by dragging from one card connector to another.

Connections can also be tapped on to edit their color and type, among other things.

You've got the gist!

I made Kinopio for people who have ideas, feelings, or thoughts they’re struggling to express, organize, and understand. I used it to plan out this blog post [[screenshot]](/images/2019/screenshot-blog-planning-kinopio.png).

It also works great on phones and tablets.

Coming soon, I'll be adding collaboration features that'll let you whiteboard with a team, and better connect _what_ you're doing to [_why_](http://pketh.org/better-things.html) you're doing it.

Here's one more thing. You can use your art skills to manipulate multiple cards at once. Paint over them, and a menu of multi-card options will appear. You can also drag multiple cards around together too.

[Come through](https://kinopio.club) and let me know what you think. You can also follow my progress at [are.na](https://www.are.na/kinopio) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/KinopioClub).

In future posts, I'll talk about design choices, aesthetic influences, how I built it, and my business "plan".

See you later,

Be kind to animals,
