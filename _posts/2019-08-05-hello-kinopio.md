It's been 3~ months since I quit Glitch. From outside the city, amidst community gardens, fireflies, and lazing cats, I want to tell you what I've been working on.

[Kinopio](https://kinopio.club) is designed to get out the chaotic messy thoughts in your head, to help figure out what they mean, and how they're connected. Instead of writing in neatly structured forms and lists like a traditional planning tool, Kinopio works like your brain does. The best way to explain that is with a little tour of [kinopio.club](https://kinopio.club):

Tap anywhere to make a new card. Put an idea, thought, or feeling in it. It doesn't need to make sense right now. Make some more, wherever you want. Drag cards to move them with a jolly wiggle.

By now some of these ideas might be connected, thematically, or whatever – so let's connect them by dragging from one card connector to another.

Connections can also be tapped on and edited, you can also set a connection to be the `default` type for future connections.

You've got the gist!

I made Kinopio for people who have ideas they're struggling to express, or feelings and thoughts that they're trying to organize and understand. I used it to plan out this blog post [[screenshot]](/images/2019/screenshot-blog-planning-kinopio.png). Oh and it also works great on mobile.

I'll eventually add collaboration features that'll let you whiteboard with a team, have more efficient meetings, and help better connect _what_ you're doing to [_why_](http://pketh.org/better-things.html) you're doing it.

Here's one more thing. You can use your art skills to manipulate multiple cards at once. Just paint over them and a menu of multi-card options will appear. Of course you can also drag those selected cards around together too.

[Come through](https://kinopio.club) and let me know what you think. You can also follow my progress at [are.na](https://www.are.na/kinopio) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/KinopioClub).

In future posts, I'll talk about design choices, aesthetic influences, how I built it, and my business 'plan'.

See you later,

Be kind to animals,
