  <p>Hi,</p>

  <p>My name is Pirijan, I'm a designer and engineer trying to make software that makes your day better. Or weirder. </p>

  <p>Turns out making things is sometimes boring, sometimes surreal. So that's what this site will be about. Yup, really specific.</p>

  <p>*cough cough*</p>

  <p>See you later.</p>

  <p class="meta-page-about-end">Email me at <a href="mailto:hi@pirijan.com?subject=hi">hi@pirijan.com</a>,
    <br>or follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/pketh">@pketh</a>.
